# Discord productivity bot

not yet ready!!

Note: if you want to use the bot make sure you have added a .env file with the following

.env file
```
CLIENTID=[your client ID]
SERVERID=[your server ID]
TOKEN=[your token ID]
```

to run make sure you run `node deploy-commands.js` before `node index.js`

## What is this project?

I always felt annoyed using task management / productivity tools like trello because there was an extra step that I had to take in order to interact with those services, not only that but task management tools were not focused around daily tasks. For me I will only use a task management tool for a week or 2 at max before I completely stop using it and move on with my life. At one point I counteracted task management procrastination through making a task list in discord and highlighting tasks with emoji colour codes. Whilst a ridiculous method for productivity it significantly helped me personally.

I want to make a task management tool that reduces the activation potential for doing tasks, by bringing the app on discord, an app I'm on quite alot.

## What kind of features do I want??

For starters, I want to have tasks go under different sub catagories. These catagories include:
- Daily tasks
- Tasks with deadlines
- Overdue tasks?

The tool should be intuitive to use, make completing tasks fun and rewarding, and overall be able to boost productivity.

I would also like to make special features for motivation and analysis on productivity, such as a report card similar to fighting games on the evening and interesting statistics. You can also choose to request a csv file from the bot (assuming I find out whether this is possible or not).

## Future for this project

Ideally I want different forms of clients to be able to access the same task boards. I might create an actual web page for a better visualisation of tasks and/or a command line application for task management at a glance.
