## What is this project?

I always felt annoyed using task management / productivity tools like trello because there was an extra step that I had to take in order to interact with those services. I counteracted task management through making a task list in discord and highlighting tasks with emoji colour codes.

Whilst a ridiculous method for productivity it significantly helped me personally. I wanted this task management tool to be automated and to help me with my day to day life.
